          <strong>Summary:</strong> All tools on this site process data
          exclusively in your browser. No personal data is collected, stored, or

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how Tony's Tools (referred to as "we",
            "us", or "our") handles data when you use our website and tools
            available at
            <a href="https://get-tony.github.io">https://get-tony.github.io</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We take your privacy seriously and are committed to being
            transparent about our data practices.

          <h2>Client-Side Processing</h2>
          <p>
            <strong
              >All tools on this website are designed to operate entirely
              client-side</strong
            >
            (in your web browser) unless explicitly stated otherwise for a
            specific tool. This means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Any data you input into our tools is processed exclusively within
              your browser
            </li>
            <li>Your data does not leave your device</li>
            <li>
              Your data is not transmitted to our servers or any third-party
              servers
            </li>
            <li>
              Your data is not stored beyond your browser session unless you
              explicitly save it
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, when using the Inventory Viewer tool, your Ansible
            inventory JSON data is parsed and displayed entirely within your
            browser. The data is not sent anywhere else.
