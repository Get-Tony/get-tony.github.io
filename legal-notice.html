        <h2>Content Responsibility according to § 55 Abs. 2 RStV</h2>
        <p>Anthony Pagan</p>

        <p>
          All content on this website has been created with the utmost care.
          However, I cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness
          of the content. The use of the content is at your own risk.

        <h3>Liability for Content</h3>
        <p>
          The contents of these pages were created with the greatest care.
          However, I cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness
          of the contents. As a service provider, I am responsible for my own
          content on these pages according to § 7 paragraph 1 TMG. According to
          §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, I am not obligated to monitor transmitted or
          stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that
          indicate illegal activity.
        </p>

        <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
        <p>
          This website contains links to the GitHub repository of the project.
          For the content of the linked pages, the respective provider or
          operator of the pages is responsible. The linked pages were checked
          for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents
          were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent
          control of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without
          concrete evidence of a violation of law. Upon notification of
          violations, I will remove such links immediately.
