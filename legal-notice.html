    <h3>Liability for Content</h3>
    <p>
      The contents of these pages were created with the greatest care. However,
      I cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the
      contents. As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on
      these pages according to ¬ß 7 paragraph 1 TMG. According to ¬ß¬ß 8 to 10 TMG,
      however, I am not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party

    <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
    <p>
      This website contains links to the GitHub repository of the project. For
      the content of the linked pages, the respective provider or operator of
      the pages is responsible. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
      violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable
      at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the contents of
      the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a
      violation of law. Upon notification of violations, I will remove such
