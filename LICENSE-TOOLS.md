## Scope Clarification

This MIT license applies to:

1. All content contained within the `/tools/` directory, including:
   - Tool source code
   - Tool-specific documentation
   - Tool-specific styling and assets
   - Any other files needed for the tool to function independently

Each tool in the `/tools/` directory is designed to be fully self-contained and can be
copied to another location and used independently of the platform.

This license explicitly **does not apply** to:

1. The platform framework, including design, styling, navigation, and structure
2. Any code or content outside the `/tools/` directory
3. The overall website architecture and organization

All elements not covered by this MIT license are subject to all rights reserved, with no permissions
granted for use, modification, or distribution without explicit permission.
