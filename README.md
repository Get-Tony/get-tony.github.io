# Tony's Tools

A modern, modular web application for managing and accessing various tools and utilities.

## Overview

Tony's Tools is a clean, responsive web application that provides a unified interface for accessing multiple tools. The application features a card-based UI with tools organized by categories, making it easy to find and use the tools you need.

## Features

- **Dynamic Tool Loading**: Each tool's HTML, CSS, and JS are loaded on demand for modularity and performance
- **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Wide, Responsive Tool Views**: Tools use the full width of the browser on desktop, with a centered card for main content
- **Category Organization**: Tools are grouped by category for easy navigation
- **Hash-based Navigation**: URLs include tool IDs for direct access and bookmarking
- **Clean, Modern Interface**: Minimalist design with smooth transitions and hover effects
- **Sticky Footer**: Footer always stays at the bottom of the page for a polished look
- **Collapsible UI Sections**: Many tools feature collapsible instructions and input areas for a cleaner interface
- **Client-Side Processing**: All tools operate entirely in your browser for privacy

## Tool Configuration

Tools are defined in the `tools/tools.json` file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "id": "tool-id",
      "name": "Tool Name",
      "description": "Tool description",
      "path": "tools/tool-directory/",
      "icon": "ðŸ“¦",
      "category": "category-name"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Tool Properties

## Adding a New Tool

To add a new tool to the application:

2. Add the tool's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to this directory
3. Add a new entry to the `tools/tools.json` file with the tool's configuration

The application uses a clean, modern design system with:

- **Color Scheme**: Blue-based palette with white backgrounds and subtle shadows
- **Typography**: Segoe UI font family for clean, readable text
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins throughout
- **Components**: Card-based UI with hover effects and smooth transitions
- **Responsive Layout**: Grid-based layout that adapts to different screen sizes
